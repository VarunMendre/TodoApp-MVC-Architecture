# 📝 TodoApp — MVC Architecture Practice Project

## 📌 Overview
This **TodoApp** is a simple Node.js project built to understand and implement the **MVC (Model–View–Controller)** architecture.  
It demonstrates how to structure backend applications cleanly with proper separation of concerns.  
Unlike modern setups handled by frameworks like React or Angular, this project integrates **server-side rendered JSX views** for learning purposes.
